# Filter-Images-Script-In-C

### Part of the CS50 Curriculum- Used GrayScale, Sepia, Reflect(horizontally) and Blur  

[CS50 Filter Less](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/psets/4/filter/less/)

I ran the script on the CS50 ide using these functions for executing the make file for respective filter

1. GrayScale
$ ./filter -g infile.bmp outfile.bmp

2. Sepia
 $ ./filter -s infile.bmp outfile.bmp
 
3. Reflect
$ ./filter -r infile.bmp outfile.bmp

4. Blur 
$ ./filter -b infile.bmp outfile.bmp

The make file contains terminal commands to execute all the files. Normal GCC compilers don't have enabled make files option by default
so you might wanna look at this for a better understanding :
